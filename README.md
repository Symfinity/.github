# Tools that give developers time. And freedom.

Symfinity is an independent, donation-based initiative with one goal: to strengthen the Symfony ecosystem for the long term. Not through marketing, not through over-engineering, but through honestly pragmatic open-source tools that make developers more productive every day.

With over a quarter of a century of real-world IT and software experience behind us, we've created a toolkit that doesn't follow trends, but addresses problems that arise daily in projects: friction, lack of standards, unnecessary complexity, and poor developer experience.

We believe that software can be more beautiful, clearer, and more intuitive. And we believe that a healthy ecosystem is built collaboratively — through many small improvements that suddenly make a big difference.

## Our Mission

* **Maximize the Developer Experience**
  Tools that feel natural, work elegantly, and deliver real value in seconds.

* **Strengthening Symfony – sustainably**
  Through consistent concepts, reusable building blocks, and ideas that save time in every project.

* **Community before complexity**
  We think of open source as a shared ecosystem, not as a stage for individuals.

* **Practice over theory**
  Everything that is created must solve real problems. No experiments in a vacuum.

## Why Symfinity?

Because developers deserve better tools. Because large organizations are sometimes too sluggish. And because small, focused tools are often the ones that can lift entire projects.

Symfinity sees itself as a DX foundation in development: a growing project that is laying a robust foundation step by step for clean, modern, and inspiring Symfony development.

## Why support us now?

Your support enables:

* More time for open-source work, instead of squeezing it in between client meetings
* Sustainability, instead of short-lived hype projects
* A neutral, independent, and transparent platform
* The development of an ecosystem that ensures higher quality, more enjoyment, and less frustration in the long run

If Symfinity saves you time in the long run, reduces technical debt, or simply saves you a lot of stress—then even a small contribution helps carry this momentum into a stable future.

## Our Vision

A community that empowers each other.
An ecosystem that not only works, but inspires.
A movement that demonstrates what happens when DX becomes a priority.

**Symfinity is the beginning.**

The rest will be created together with you.
